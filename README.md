- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for running the local server)

## **Project Setup**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kaerias/EPSI_coding_club.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

## **How It Works**

The project generates a customizable Christmas tree based on user input:
- **Height Input**: Users specify the height of the tree (e.g., 5‚Äì30 levels).
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Each level of the tree is dynamically created using JavaScript.
- **Blinking Lights**: The lights on the tree change colors periodically for a festive effect.
